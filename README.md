# Viberaria
A Buttplug.io Mod for Terraria/tModLoader

# Notes
I developed this mod for tModLoader 1.4.4 which is currently in preview in anticipation of the mod breaking and many changes that I noticed in the brief time that I worked on this project on the current stable release and the preview. I currently won't be working on a version of the mod for the current stable release and instead will continue to add features and work on customization while developing with the 1.4.4 preview in mind.
If 1.4.4 isn't released by the time I am finishing I will support the current stable release.

# Installation
1) Download the latest release
2) Open the Mods directory at Documents\My Games\Terraria\tModLoader\Mods
3) Insert the file into the Mods directory.
4) Open and run a server with Intiface
5) Launch tModLoader and enable the mod
